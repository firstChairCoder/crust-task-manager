# ðŸ“±ðŸŽ† React Native Developer - Coding Assessment
## ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾ Task Manager

My application aims to solve the question of people who are starting to watch Rick and Morty and don't know very well what the animated series is about, don't know who the characters are - if they are alive, what planet they are from, etc.
As this is a complex design, involving many universes, many may not understand very well what is happening, so this API shows details of some characters, explains about the pilot of the series and sends the user to a website that has detailed information made by the fandom itself.

## Installation

The following steps assumes your environment is already set up for running Expo/React Native apps.  
If this is your first time, check out the [official set up guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) beforehand.

- Fork the repo and clone to your machine.
- Run `yarn` command.
- Run `npx expo start` to start the metro development server
- Choose the appropriate option in the resulting menu, depending on what simulator/emulator/device(using Expo Go) you want to run the app on.

### N.B:
There's an .apk release that you can download to run the app on your Android device directly.

## âœ¨ Layout 

This application was made with responsive design in mind. This allows for similar design forms in both tablets and phones of various screen sizes.

## ðŸ˜¥ Limitations 

I chose to limit the persistence to the current user. What this means is that if the user logs out (_by pressing the back button on the Home Screen_), all the previously persisted data is deleted.
